HardRod

Michael Stefferson

Description: Uses DDFT to solve driven hard rod continuum equations in 2D.
Hard interact through steric interactions. This approximated using Onsager
2nd Virial.

Executeables:
InptMkrHRIDCexe.m: Solves the temporal evolution of a density profile of 
driven hard rod.

INFinder2DddftNbcLoop.m: Finds the average nematic order parameter at 
steady state.

Folders:
Subroutines: The library

RodsFullInteract: This still need to be intergrated into the system.
